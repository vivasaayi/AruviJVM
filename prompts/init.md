I want to implement a JavaByte Code interpreter in C. The end goal is that the byte code interpreter will run in a RISC-V computer

I want to use very basic c contructs, so that I can compile using my own simple c compiler.

I am not worried about the performance as of now.

Regarding the Java Code, I dont want to be so crazy. I want to start very simple. I want to make sure I can implement Data Structures and Algorithms and very simple Embedded Control programs.

To start with, help me to compile the interpreter using a C Compiler. We can then port it to my own compiler.
